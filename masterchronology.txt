<H1>The Dated Master Dendrochronology </H1>
<P>What is a dated master dendrochronology?  See figure at right:
<UL>
<IMG SRC="chronology.gif" HEIGHT=201 WIDTH=285 ALIGN=RIGHT>
<LI> Constructed from previously crossdated samples
<LI> Has calendar years, 1895 to 1926, in this case
<LI> Time series of standardized growth indices
<UL>
<LI> Average of 1.0, normal growth
<LI> Minimum of 0.0, below-average no growth
<LI> Maximum of 2.0, above-average to great growth
</UL>
<LI> Marked as if it were a skeleton plot
<UL>
<LI> Small indices represented by long marks hanging down (e.g., 1919)
<LI> Large indices represented by "b" marks (e.g., 1922 and 1926)
</UL>
</UL>
Good idea: To see how to make marks when skeleton plotting, look at the master chronology to see what values of ring growth merit a long mark versus no mark at all versus a "b" mark
