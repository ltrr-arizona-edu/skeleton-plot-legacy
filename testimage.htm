Once a sample is skeleton plotted, the plot is&nbsp;<IMG SRC="chronology.gif" HEIGHT=201 WIDTH=285 ALIGN=RIGHT>compared
to an existing dated master chronology to match its pattern of marks in
mirror image and thus find the exact years of formation of all rings. &amp;nbsp;
For example, the dated master chronology above is constructed from previously
crossdated samples, it extends from 1885 to 1973, and it has a time series
of standardized growth indices that average 1.0 and that range from 0.0
(very little growth) to 2.0 (maximum growth). &amp;nbsp; &lt;IMG SRC="chronology.gif">
The master is also marked as if it were a skeleton plot, with small indices
represented by long marks and large indices represented by "b" marks. &amp;nbsp;
(For a good idea of how to make marks when skeleton plotting, look at the
master chronology to see what values of ring growth merit a long mark versus
no mark at all versus a "b" mark).
