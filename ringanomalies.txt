<H1>Ring Anomalies</H1>
<P> Note that the sample skeleton plot above has an absent ring anomaly: the chronology has an index value of 0.0 for 1859, which corresponds to the sample ring #14, which was quite normal and didn't merit any mark on the skeleton plot. &nbsp; In reality, this sample failed to grow a ring that year, and to indicate this anomaly a dashed line is drawn on the skeleton plot between the 13th and 14th lines. &nbsp; To maintain proper timing, the skeleton plot must then be slid one graph unit to the right relative to the master chronology. &nbsp; On the applet, make an absent ring mark by selecting the "draw absent" option and using the mouse as before and then move the skeleton plot one position to the right.

<P>Note also that the sample above has a false ring anomaly: the chronology has an index value of 2.0 for 1962, which corresponds to the sample ring #16, which was quite normal and didn't merit a "b" mark on the skeleton plot. &nbsp; In reality, this sample grew two rings that year, and to indicate this anomaly a dashed diagonal line is drawn on the skeleton plot on the 16th line. &nbsp; To maintain proper timing, the skeleton plot must then be slid one graph unit to the left relative to the master chronology. &nbsp; On the applet, make a false ring mark by selecting the "draw false" option and using the mouse as before and then move the skeleton plot one position to the left.

<P>In the case above, the relative displacements of the absent and false rings offset one another perfectly such that the other marks on the skeleton plot match the marks of the master quite well. &nbsp; This won't happen in reality, of course, nor will it happen on the crossdating applet. &nbsp;
